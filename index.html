        <p> I'm a passionate life coach driven by a desire to make a 
          positive impact on people's lives. Becoming a life coach 
          has enriched my own journey, providing me with a sense of 
          purpose and fulfillment. I draw energy from witnessing the 
          resilience and potential within each individual. 
          Guiding others and witnessing their growth fuels my own 
          personal development. I'm honored to walk alongside clients, 
          empowering them to tap into their strengths, achieve their goals, 
          and live authentically. Let's embark on this transformative journey together!

          <p>I would like to Thank You, Nicole for being  my coach and a part of my journey of discovering my own self and getting even more clarity about life and values! One of the advantages having you as a coach was that is very easy to build rapport with you. I felt very open and comfortable during our sessions. And by giving me a safe space to be vulnerable and honest you let me feel free to share my thoughts, feelings, struggles and obstacles, I could cry freely and express my feelings without being judged, and at times we all know it is just so so needed. 
            Throughout our sessions you helped me to get clarity of which parts of my life I need to pay attention and work on in order to uplift my journey, you also got me doing the exercise to clarify my values and what matters to me the most, so I got to understand the power of being kind and self-forgiving.
            I really think that you are a great coach because you know how to listen, how to leave that silent space for what person has to say. You indeed can make person feel mattered! 
            Thank you so much for being part of my journey and making me feel heard. It is a joy to work with you!
             All the best to you, Nicole!
            <br> <br>
            with respect, Kami

        <p>Nicole is a great coach. I really liked how easy it was to schedule calls 
          with her and to take care of the formalities so that the focus was on our sessions. 
          She created an open and friendly atmosphere from the start. I always felt comfortable 
          and understood and the pace was great so that I could always integrate the new awareness 
          into my day to day life. I can definitely recommend Nicole to anyone who has had negative 
          experiences with being judged for health and/or weight issues in the past.
